# Youth Risk Behavior Analysis

This repository contains my individual project for **TIS 2101: IT Project Management**. This project visualizes and analyzes risk behaviors among middle school students in the United States, based on data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), focusing on mental health indicators, bullying, and demographic factors.

## Project Overview
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) dataset provides insights into priority health behaviors among middle school youth, including behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence, substance use, mental health, and physical activity levels. This study covers data from **1997 to 2017**, examining specific factors affecting mental health and related risk behaviors by gender, location, and grade.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/us-hhs-gov/a0d6c38b-93a2-4a60-8651-a870cf07583c) and contains 35,508 records with 27 attributes, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, grade, and location
- **Behavioral Indicators**: Instances of bullying, substance use, physical activity, and mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, suicidal thoughts)

## Key Insights
1. **Prevalence of Mental Health Issues by Gender**: Female students showed a higher prevalence of mental health issues compared to male students, especially in categories like bullying and cyberbullying.
2. **Location-Based Trends**: Maryland had the highest prevalence of students reporting mental health issues, highlighting regional differences.
3. **Grade-Level Patterns**: Risk behaviors and mental health issues were more pronounced in 7th and 8th graders compared to 6th graders.

## Data Visualization
This project includes multiple visualizations created using **Cole Nussbaumer's 4A** design principles:
- **Accurate**: Data represented accurately without distortion.
- **Actionable**: Interactive filters enable users to explore data by year, grade, gender, and risk factors.
- **Accessible**: Clear labels and color differentiation ensure visualizations are easy to interpret.
- **Aesthetic**: Visually engaging charts, heatmaps, and bar charts illustrate trends and patterns effectively.

### Most Insightful Visualization
The **heatmap** visualization of mental health risk factors among female middle school students provided valuable insights, revealing high rates of bullying and cyberbullying in Maryland, along with associated mental health risks.

## Possible Explanation
The higher prevalence of mental health issues in Maryland may be influenced by socioeconomic and educational factors unique to the region. The increased risk among female students aligns with studies on gender differences in mental health, where societal pressures and different coping mechanisms contribute to varying levels of vulnerability.
